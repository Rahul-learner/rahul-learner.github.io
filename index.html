    <h1>Native Drag and Drop<br>Dragging files directly onto the website</h1>

    <article class="dnd-onto-website cf">
      <h3>Drag external images into the container below</h3>
      
      <h4 class="ie-message">You are using Internet Explorer. IE only supports the 'text' and 'URL' transfer types so your experience may be limited. Also IE9 and below have no support for dragging images from your desktop to the page</h4>
      <div class="container-drop drop"></div>
      <div class="message-container"></div>
      
      <p>Any draggable elements (images, link tags, selected text) can be dropped here, but <strong>only dragged images from external sites / uploaded images will be displayed</strong></p>
      <p>Some images are wrapped around an anchor tag, these won't work as the API will consider the drop to be a 'link' and not an 'image'</p>
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Most images online will be wrapped around a &lt;a&GT; tag. When you drag and drop these it looks like you're dragging the image but actually you're dragging the link (which won't work below). This is a limitation of the API </li>
        <li>There is no concept of what an "image" is to the API. As such we need to check to see if the URI supplied has a filetype in it. We check the URL to see if it contains the '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png' ,'.bmp', or '.gif' extension</li>
        <li>Some CND's use strange URL patterns that don't end in a specific file type. These won't work as the API won't be able to tell what it is.</li>
